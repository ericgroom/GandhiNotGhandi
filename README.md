# GandhiNotGhandi
A reddit bot that denounces users who spell Ghandi wrong

I was inspired by all of the jokes on a reddit thread to write a bot that would correct people spelling Gandhi's name wrong, as it happens so frequently.

After asking the moderators of /r/Civ (where I wanted to run the bot) they denied me access so I stopped developing this project but it is nearly done. For future projects I will make sure to obtain permission as to not waste time.
